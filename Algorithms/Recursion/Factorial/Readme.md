# RULES OF RECURSION
3 things needed for a ***recursive function***:

1. Base Case - when to stop the function from calling itself 
2. Identify the recursive case - action that is performed
3. Get closer and closer, **return** when specified in base case and when needed. This amounts to two total **return** statements
